# Welcome to Vim [PART-1]

Vim is a very powerful shiz

There are ports to all major IDEs
gets tied to your muscle memory. Typing is not a blocker. helps easily in churning out text. Going back will feel like stone age.

## What the hell is this Vim?

Goes well with the linux philosophy of- Do one thing and do it well

## What we'll be discussing:

Vim




## How to install

Some form of Vim will come preinstalled in (almost) all the prominent linux distributions (even if you manage to hack into an android phone or a server). However, that preinstalled form might be limited, as is the case of recent Ubuntu distributions, which ships with ```Vi```, the predecessor of Vim. ~A long time ago there existed the powerful editors ed and vi~ We will be discussing about the rich heritage history about Vim, but some other day. For now, installation is as simple as- 
```bash
sudo apt install vim 
```
To check the installation, open up a terminal and type ```vim```


## How to Quit

This question is one of the most frequent question asked on Stackoverflow, and is an element to a plethora of memes like [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/33a6p7/how_do_you_generate_a_random_string/)
> **How do you generate a random string?**  
> Put a fresh student in front of vim and tell him to quit.

For now, Just remember this- 
```
:q!  # To force quit without saving anything
:wq  # To write and quit
```
Don't worry, We'll discuss why this process is so quirky. It'll all make sense in some time.


## Why the quit process is so quirky (Modes in Vim)
One of the reasons why Vim is so powerful, is because Vim unlike other editors, is a *Modal* editor. This means, the keys of the keyboard have a different functions associated to them when they are in different modes. There are 6 total modes in Vim, out of which you will be dealing with 3 modes on a day-to-day basis:  

* **NORMAL Mode**  
This is the default mode Vim starts in. You can NOT insert text directly in this mode. There are various Text Editing functionalities available in this mode, which we'll discuss in later part. You are ideally supposed to stay in this mode all the time when you are not entering any text.  
  
* **INSERT Mode**   
This is the mode where you go in to insert text. In this mode, the editor functions similar to any other text editor, and hence is the most appealing mode to be initially. But in an ideal scenario, you should leave this mode as soon as you are done entering text. To go to this mode, press ```i``` in ```NORMAL``` mode. There are some advanced ways to get into this mode, which are discussed later.  
  
* **COMMAND Mode**
This mode supports entering custom commands, including file operations like Opening, Closing, and saving. This mode can be invoked by pressing ```:``` in ```NORMAL``` mode. This is the reason why to quit a file, you need to go to ```COMMAND``` mode first by invoking `:`, and then press ``wq`` to *write and quit*, or ```q!``` to *quit forcefully*. 

This is better described in the diagram below:

This mode also supports some advanced batch text editing functionalities, which we'll discuss in the next discussion.



* **VISUAL Modes**  
This mode is used to Visually Select some part of text. There are further subparts to this mode:  
  
- Visual Character Mode (```v``` in ```NORMAL``` mode to invoke)
 Mode to select on character basis.

- Visual Line Mode (```Shift + v``` in ```NORMAL``` mode to invoke)
Mode to select on Line basis

- Block Mode (```Ctrl + v``` in ```NORMAL``` mode to invoke)
Mode to select on Block basis

* **EX mode**

We wil be discussing the basics of the first three modes mentioned in bold in this session. We'll be discussing the other modes and advanced modes in later discussions.
