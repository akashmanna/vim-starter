# Welcome to Vim

Vim is a very powerful shiz

gvim
neovim (nvim)

There are ports to all major IDEs

## What the hell is this Vim?

Goes well with the linux philosophy of- Do one thing and do it well

## What we'll be discussing:

Vim




## How to install

Some form of Vim will come preinstalled in (almost) all the prominent linux distributions (even if you manage to hack into an android phone or a server). However, that preinstalled form might be limited, as is the case of recent Ubuntu distributions, which ships with ```Vi```, the predecessor of Vim. ~A long time ago there existed the powerful editors ed and vi~ We will be discussing about the rich heritage history about Vim, but some other day. For now, installation is as simple as- 
```bash
sudo apt install vim 
```
To check the installation, open up a terminal and type ```vim```


## How to Quit

This question is one of the most frequent question asked on Stackoverflow, and is an element to a plethora of memes like [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/33a6p7/how_do_you_generate_a_random_string/)
> **How do you generate a random string?**  
> Put a fresh student in front of vim and tell him to quit.

For now, Just remember this- 
```
:q!  # To force quit without saving anything
:wq  # To write and quit
```
Don't worry, We'll discuss why this process is so quirky. It'll all make sense in some time.
